# Marketplace-Hotel-Booking with Stripe API

* React.js & Redux
* Node
* Express
* Mongodb
* Stripe

# I have build a Marketplace app with similar concept used by sites like eBay, Udemy, E-commerce Marketplace, Online Service Booking (e.g. Car servicing, Hotel Booking, Beauty Parlor Booking  etc).

* This app will allow users to post services/products on your site.

* Let users buy those products/services.

* As a platform owner, you will collect money from customers and pay to sellers.

* In-between you will take certain percentage/commission/fee for being a platform owner.

* You will host two different types of users in your app. one is seller who will sell products or services, for example a hotel owner who will post his hotel rooms available for     booking. Other type is buyer who will buy products or services, for example a user who want to book a hotel room.

* The entire payment flow will be automated using stripe. When a customer pays using their credit card, stripe will allocate certain percentage to the seller and certain         percentage to the platform owner (platform fee). Then every week, stripe will automatically pay the balance to the account holders directly to their bank account.
